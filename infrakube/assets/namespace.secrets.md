# **Secrets**


## **What is a Kubernetes Secret?**

A **Kubernetes Secret** is a resource used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, SSH keys,
and certificates, in a Kubernetes cluster. Rather than hardcoding sensitive data in application code or configuration 
files, secrets allow Kubernetes to manage and distribute this information securely across the cluster to containers 
that need it.

Secrets are encoded (typically in Base64) and can be mounted as files or exposed as environment variables to the 
containers in Pods.

## **Why Use Secrets?**

The main reasons for using Kubernetes Secrets are:

- **Security**: Storing sensitive data in a secret ensures it is not exposed in plain text within container images, 
  configuration files, or logs.
- **Centralized Management**: Secrets provide a centralized, managed way to store and distribute sensitive information 
  in your cluster, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
- **Flexibility**: Secrets can be injected into Pods as environment variables or mounted as files, making it flexible 
  to configure sensitive data access.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Application code can remain agnostic to sensitive details like credentials, which are 
  injected at runtime through Kubernetes Secrets.

## **Types of Kubernetes Secrets**

Kubernetes supports several types of Secrets, each serving different use cases:

1. **Opaque** (default):  
   Stores arbitrary user-defined data, such as passwords or API tokens.

2. **Service Account Token Secret**:  
   Automatically created by Kubernetes to grant Pods access to the Kubernetes API.

3. **Docker Config Secrets**:  
   Used to store Docker credentials, allowing the Pod to pull images from private Docker registries.

4. **TLS Secrets**:  
   Used to store a TLS certificate and key, primarily for configuring HTTPS in an Ingress resource.

5. **Basic Authentication Secrets**:  
   Stores basic auth credentials like a username and password.

## **Key Components of a Secret**

1. **Data**:  
   The sensitive data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a human-readable string, and the value is
   Base64-encoded data.

2. **Metadata**:  
   Includes the name, namespace, labels, and annotations that help identify and organize the secret within the 
   Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Type**:  
   Indicates the specific type of secret (e.g., Opaque, TLS). This helps Kubernetes and applications understand 
   how to handle the secret.

## **Example of a Secret Definition**

Here’s an example of a simple Kubernetes secret definition that stores a password:

### YAML Definition:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=       # Base64 encoded 'admin'
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm # Base64 encoded '1f2d1e2e67df'
```

In this example:
- The secret named `db-secret` stores a username and password.
- The values `YWRtaW4=` and `MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm` are Base64-encoded data representing `admin` and `1f2d1e2e67df`, 
  respectively.

To decode the values, you can use a Base64 decoder (or `base64 -d` in a shell command).

## **Best Practices for Secrets**

1. **Use Encryption**:  
   By default, secrets are stored unencrypted in etcd (the cluster’s key-value store). Enable encryption at rest for 
   secrets using encryption providers for better security.

2. **Avoid Hardcoding**:  
   Don’t hardcode sensitive information in application code or configuration files. Instead, inject secrets into your 
   applications using Kubernetes mechanisms like environment variables or volume mounts.

3. **Limit Secret Access**:  
   Use **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** to restrict access to secrets only to the namespaces and Pods that need them.

4. **Use Automatic Secret Rotation**:  
   If you use tools like HashiCorp Vault or external secret management systems, automate secret rotation for better 
   security hygiene.

5. **Handle Base64 with Care**:  
   Secrets in Kubernetes are Base64-encoded, not encrypted. Ensure proper access control and consider encryption when 
   necessary.

6. **Use External Secret Managers**:  
   For highly sensitive data, consider using external secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets 
   Manager, or Azure Key Vault) that can be integrated with Kubernetes.

## **Common Use Cases for Secrets**

1. **Database Credentials**:  
   Store and manage database credentials securely, injecting them into Pods when needed.

2. **API Tokens and Keys**:  
   Keep API tokens for accessing external services like cloud APIs or third-party services securely stored and
   accessed within the cluster.

3. **TLS Certificates**:  
   Use secrets to store and serve TLS certificates for secure HTTPS traffic in Ingress resources.

4. **SSH Keys**:  
   Store SSH keys in a secret to allow secure access to external systems.
